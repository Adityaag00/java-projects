Radon Gas
Radon is a naturally occurring gas that can affect land and property across the United Kingdom. It typically has a low
impact, but at certain percentages determined to be above the Action Level by the Health Protection Agency or its
predecessor the National Radiation Protection Board, there may be recommended steps. The vendor should state
whether the radon concentration has been measured in the property; whether the result was at or above the Action Level
and if so whether remedial measures were installed and whether the radon concentration was re-tested to assess the
effectiveness of the remedy.
New buildings in High Risk areas are required to have preventative measures. The developer or vendor of any property
constructed since 1988 should be able to state if protective measures were included during the build.
Do records indicate that the property is in a “Radon Affected Area” as identified by Public Health
England or Public Health Wales?

(a)
The Localism Act 2011 introduces an important new power for local communities to protect buildings and open spaces
they value. The Community Right to Bid came into effect on 21 September 2012. This is relevant to all civic societies and
community groups. This new right means communities can ask their local council to list certain assets as being of value
to the community. If an asset is listed and then comes up for sale, the new right will give communities that want it 6
months to put together a bid to buy it.

If you have a query or complaint about your search, you should raise it directly with the search firm, and if appropriate ask for any complaint to be
